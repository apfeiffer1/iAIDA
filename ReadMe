iAIDA is a library implementing the AIDA (http://aida.freehep.org)
Abstract Interfaces for Data Analysis. The implementation is in
C++, at some later stage a binding to Python will follow.

iAIDA is based on the (now discontinued) PI (http://cern.ch/pi)
package. The main aim of iAIDA is to be easy to configure but
keep the flexibility of PI in terms of providing means to use
several of the most common I/O formats used in High Energy and
Nuclear Physics (HENP), such as HBOOK, ROOT and the AIDA native
compressed XML format.

For more information please consult: http://iaida.dynalias.net

The remainder of the file deals with the installation. For the
impatient, the recipe is (after unpacking and cd into the unpacked
dir):

./configure 
make
make install


The iAIDA package needs the following packages already installed 
(with their "development" packages as well):
e2fsprogs (version 1.39-21 tested)
expat (version 1.95.8 tested)
Boost (version 1.33.1 tested)
optionally: xmgrace (versions 5.1.14 and 5.1.20 tested)
optionally: cernlib (version 2005 tested)
optionally: root (version 5.17.02 tested)


Also AIDA (version 3.2.1) is used, if you have it installed, 
the package will use (and install) your version, otherwise 
it uses (and installs) a local copy from inside the package.

In the same way, if you don't have Boost installed, the package
will use the headers from a local copy. Expat is normally part
of any modern linux installation, so there is no local copy.

To install the package into /usr/local (assuming that the other 
packages are installed there too):

tar zxf iAIDA-1.0.2.tgz
cd iAIDA-1.0.2
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install

The configure script will tell you if it doesn't find one of 
the needed packages, if you have installed it in another place, 
you can tell the script to find it where you have installed it, 
for example:

./configure --prefix=${HOME}/install \
      --with-boost=/my/path/to/boost \
      --with-grace=${GRACE_DIR}

For more information on how to use it, just type :

./configure --help

to see a list of options and examples.

The package has been successfully build and run on the following
platforms:
Mac OS X (10.4.7) with gcc 4.0.1
Scientific Linux 3.0 (SLC3) with gcc 3.2.3
Scientific Linux 4.0 (SLC4) with gcc 3.4.6
SuSE 10.2 with gcc 4.1.2 (gfortran)

As of version 0.1.4 the package optionally can store and read
histograms also in HBOOK format (if you have CERNLIB installed 
before building the package).

As of version 0.2.0 the package optionally can store and read
histograms also in ROOT format.



Note for building on Mac OS X (10.4.x):
---------------------------------------

You can download and install xmgrace from the Fink project,
the package will then be installed in the /sw directory (or
wherever you install Fink software). Simply use the configure
option to tell the package where xmgrace is installed:

./configure --prefix=../install/ --with-grace=/sw



Note for building on SL(C)4 (gcc345) on AMD64 with HBOOK:
-----------------------------------------------------------

At present there is a problem with column-wise HBOOK ntuples on 
64 bit machines (such as AMD64 bit). If you need that feature,
you will have to use a 32bit build of CERNLIB to use HBook with 
iAIDA. After installing this, you need to configure and build 
the iAIDA libs with the following commands (after unpacking the 
tarball):


linux32 ./configure --prefix <your/path/to/prefix> \
   --with-cernlib <your/path/to/cernlib/in/ia32/mode> 
linux32 make CXXFLAGS='-m32'
linux32 make CXXFLAGS='-m32' install


If you can live with row-wise HBOOK ntuples, simply use the
'--RWN' option to the creation of the tuple (the last argument
in the tupleFactory->create() call).



Note for building on SL(C)4 (gcc345) on AMD64 with xmgrace:
-----------------------------------------------------------

When you build grace, you have to set CFLAGS to -fPIC
before, otherwise you will get a linker error when building 
the iAIDA lib. The following worked for me:
CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure ...
CFLAGS=-fPIC make
