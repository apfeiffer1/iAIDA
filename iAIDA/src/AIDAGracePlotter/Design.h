A plotter (loosely based on an early verison of the AIDA 3.x interfaces)
built on top of the Grace application
(<a href="http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace">http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace</a>).
Grace is based directly on Motif (LessTif is fine) so it is not embeddable as
a Qt widget. The interface in this version is a clunky command language
which I have hidden inside the AidaNative::Grace class. Future versions 
will (they claim)
have a programmatic interface in C++, which might even be OO. The plotter was
written to allow an implementation of the AIDA interfaces based on Grace
for use inside Lizard. When the interfaces stabilise I will write a wrapper
based on this package (first version done Oct 8th 2002 MS).
