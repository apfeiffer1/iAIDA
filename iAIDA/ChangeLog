	change names (and logic) for flags to use (or not) root (IAIDA_USE_ROOT) and Grace (IAIDA_USE_Grace)
	if they are found on the system. Add them to the set of variables which is shown in ccmake so users 
	can more easily change them. Add IAIDA_INSTALL_EXAMPLES (to allow installing executables of the 
	examples and tests in libexec/iAIDA) as well, so it shows up in ccmake.

2014-05-11 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
    fix build and compilation issues on Mavericks (OS X 10.9, LLVM version 5.1)
    added flags IAIDA_DO_NOT_USE_ROOT and IAIDA_DO_NOT_USE_GRACE to not build/link to root and/or 
    grace, even if they are installed on the system (and found automatically by cmake)
    added utilities subdir, moved (and renamed) convToCSV and showFile from examples to utilities, 
    added initial version of convToXML. cleanup in CMakeLists,
    added copying of tuples, checking if existing input/output files (using boost, therefore updated 
    boost requirements)
    use proper extensions for files. .aida should be used for compressed xml for compatibility reasons
    various fixes for tests, added more tests (using boost random)
    moved boost version to require min of 1.41 (slc5/6); fix typo in name of test (case sensitive)
    updated ReadMe, added ref to slc5/6 specific setup instructions

2013-07-11 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	added installation of sources (to share/doc/iAIDA) and binaries of examples/tests 
	(on request only, to libexec/iAIDA). silenced output from cmake for non-DEBUG builds.
	added a simple example to show the content (summary) of an .aida file
	fixed permissions for .cpp and .h files (Thanks Mojca!)
	fixed missing self. in implementation printout of aida-config
	in adia-config.in: use dir found by cmake for AIDA installation, and install_include_dir from cmake for local installation
	Tagged iAIDA-1.1.2 ------------------------------------------

2013-07-10 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	added recognition of installed AIDA, do not use local version in this case.
	moved to use boost-zlib compression filter, updated examples return values.
	removed usage of std::ends in value to string conversion
	Tagged iAIDA-1.1.1 ------------------------------------------

2013-07-08 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	removed CERNLIB from list of optional sources as Ubuntu's version does not have the 
	(essential here) functions to restore internals of HBOOK 1D and 2D histograms (hbf1al_/hbf2al_)

2013-07-05 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	updated build process to use cmake. Added CMakeLists.txt in top-level, src/, examples, and test/
	subdirs, added cmake/FindROOT.cmake and cmake/FindGrace.cmake (both found on the web)
	removed Makefile.in in all dirs, configure 
	fixed some build issues on Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
	added '--implementation' flag for aida-config (seems to be required by Geant-4 these days.
	Tagged iAIDA-1.1.0 ------------------------------------------

2011-09-08 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
    If Boost iostream libs are found on the system, enable their use so we can 
	use the gzip and bzlib2 compression (the latter is the default now). The 
	corresponding option string for the tree-creation is "gzip" and "bzip", respectively.
	configure: add discovery of boost installation with boost_iostream library
	src/AIDA_StoreXML.[h|cpp],AIDA_XMLStoreFactory.h,AIDA_XMLStoreFactory.cpp,Makefile.in:

	configure: incorporated patch for gfortran from issue ID: 3172767
	examples/samplingFromHistogram.cpp: added new example to show sampling from IHistogram1D (code from Guy)
	examples/storeRoot.cpp: added more histograms to check things
	examples/readRoot.cpp: added readback of either two histo1ds or one histo1d, one profile1d

2009-05-18 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	configure: fix an issue on SLC5 when both fortran compilers were present, 
	the linking of the examples/tests was not correct (using g77 instead of
	gfortran). Fixed to use gfortran if both are present.

2007-10-29 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	if cernlib is configured on a 64 bit architecture, the executables are now linked
	statically, this fixes the problem with the ColumnWiseNtuples in HBook. The Root
	libs (if configured) need to be static as well.

2007-10-18 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	updated Makefile for tests and examples and aida-config to explicitely use

	using shared libs.
	Tagged iAIDA-1.0.4  -----------------------------------------

2007-10-03 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	added test (testHistoName) for problem reported by Giovanni Santin with gcc 3.2.3
	(not reproducible with later compilers)
