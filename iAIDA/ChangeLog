	if cernlib is configured on a 64 bit architecture, the executables are now linked
	statically, this fixes the problem with the ColumnWiseNtuples in HBook. The Root
	libs (if configured) need to be static as well.

	added detection of libgfortran.so in case /usr/lib64 contains only versioned libs
	added linking with lg2c as cernlib seems to need that 
	Tagged iAIDA-1.0.6  -----------------------------------------

	fixed path problem in aida-config for cernlib
	Tagged iAIDA-1.0.5  -----------------------------------------

2007-10-18 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	updated Makefile for tests and examples and aida-config to explicitely use
	the cernlib if specified. This is needed in case the cernlib installation is
	using shared libs.

2007-10-03 Andreas Pfeiffer (apfeiffer1@gmail.com)
	added test (testHistoName) for problem reported by Giovanni Santin with gcc 3.2.3
	(not reproducible with later compilers)
	updated Makefile to allow parallel building
	updated configure and makefiles to use root-config results intead of the command. 
	create archive lib as well (externals need to be available as archive as well if going to be used)

	Added license (LGPL v3) files (COPYING*) and preamble to all code files.
	Changed all namespaces and include protections to use iAIDA.
	Fixed typo in class and file name of RootPathFormatter

	src/AIDA_ROOT/Profile1D.h, src/AIDA_ROOT/Profile2D.h: added conversion to double
	for args to std::sqrt as suggested by Giovanni Santin. Needed for gcc323.

	aida-config.in, configure: updated handling of Root libs when linking
	as the libs need to be present for linking when using aida-config --libs
	(includes not needed).
	src/AIDA_ROOT/Profile1D.cpp, src/AIDA_ROOT/Profile2D.cpp: added std:: to calls of sqrt
	src/NormGaussModelFunction.cpp: added std:: to calls of sqrt, added include <cmath>
