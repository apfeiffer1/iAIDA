Overview
--------

iAIDA is a library implementing the AIDA (<http://aida.freehep.org>)
Abstract Interfaces for Data Analysis. The implementation is in
C++, at some later stage a binding to Python will follow.

iAIDA is based on the (now discontinued) PI (<http://cern.ch/pi>)
package developed at CERN. The main aim of iAIDA is to be easy to 
configure but keep the flexibility of PI in terms of providing 
means to use several of the most common I/O formats used in High 
Energy and Nuclear Physics (HENP), such as HBOOK, ROOT and the 
AIDA native (compressed) XML format.

Installation
------------

As of version 1.1.0 iAIDA is build using CMake. It needs the following
packages installed on your system:

 - Boost (specifically the serialization and iostream libraries)
   (version 1.53.0 tested, should at least be 1.49.0)
 - expat (version 2.0.1 tested)
 - zlib  (version 1.2.5 tested)

Also AIDA (version 3.2.1) is needed, if you have it installed, the 
package will use your installed version, otherwise it uses (and installs) 
a local copy from inside the package.

Optionally, iAIDA will provide added functionality if the following
packages are installed and found on your system:

 - ROOT (<http://root.cern.ch>) for storing/reading histograms and tuples using root I/O
 - Grace (<http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/>) for plotting using the AIDA Grace Plotter package [1]

[1] you will need to rebuild Grace from scratch and compile with the 
-fPIC option to get a shared library, the static lib coming with most
linux packaging managers will not work.

To build and install the whole package in the default location used 
by cmake (usually /usr/local/), you should unpack the package and 
then do the build in a separate directory ("out of source build" 
of cmake):

	tar zxf iAIDA-1.1.2.tgz
	cd iAIDA-1.1.2
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make 
	make install

In case you want to install into a different directory than the
default used by cmake (usually /usr/local/), run the "cmake .."
step above like this:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/your/path/to/the/install/area/ ..

(note the space between the install path and the ".."). This will then 
create the lib/bin/include directories for the installation in the given
install path: /your/path/to/the/install/area/

If you want to install the binaries of the examples and tests, you can add
"-DIAIDA_INSTALL_EXAMPLES=ON" to the cmake command, they will then get installed 
into <installPrefix>/libexec/iAIDA/.

Happy cloning and forking ! :)
