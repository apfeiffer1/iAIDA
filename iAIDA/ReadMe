iAIDA is a library implementing the AIDA (http://aida.freehep.org)
Abstract Interfaces for Data Analysis. The implementation is in
C++, at some later stage a binding to Python will follow.

iAIDA is based on the (now discontinued) PI (http://cern.ch/pi)
package. The main aim of iAIDA is to be easy to configure but
keep the flexibility of PI in terms of providing means to use
several of the most common I/O formats used in High Energy and
Nuclear Physics (HENP), such as HBOOK, ROOT and the AIDA native
compressed XML format.

For more information please consult: http://iaida.dynalias.net

The remainder of the file deals with the installation. As of 
version 1.1.0 iAIDA is build using cmake and needs the following
packages installed on your system:
 - Boost (specifically the serialization and iostream libraries)
   (version 1.53.0 tested, should at least be 1.49.0)
 - expat (version 2.0.1 tested)
 - zlib  (version 1.2.5 tested)

Also AIDA (version 3.2.1) is needed, and if you have it installed, 
the package will use your installed version, otherwise it uses (and 
installs) a local copy from inside the package.

Optionally, iAIDA will build added functionality if the following
packages are installed and found on your system:
 - ROOT - will enable storing/reading using root I/O
 - Grace - will enable and build the AIDA Grace Plotter package
 - HBook (from CERNlib) - will enable storing/reading hbook files

To build and install the whole package in the default location used 
by cmake (usually /usr/local/), you should unpack the package and 
then do the build in a separate directory ("out of source build" 
of cmake):

	tar zxf iAIDA-1.1.0.tgz
	cd iAIDA-1.1.0
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make 
	make install

In case you want to install into a different directory than the
default used by cmake (usually /usr/local/), run the "cmake .."
step above like this:

	cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/your/path/to/the/install/area/ ..

This will then create the lib/bin/include directories for the installation
in /your/path/to/the/install/area/
