      <h2>Reading a ROOT Tree, filling AIDA histograms and plotting them in HippoDraw</h2>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>

      <h3>Python program</h3>
      <p>Click to retrieve <a href="readTree.py">the Python script</a> of the example.</p>

      <p>After having <a href="howtosetup.html">setup</a> correctly your environment, you can run the example typing :<br />
	<kbd>python -i rootDemo.py
	</kbd> </p>

      <h3>Program flow</h3>
      <ol><li>Python bindings to ROOT classes are imported from the ROOT module
          (from PyROOT). </li>
        <li>The ROOT file is open and the tree is read. The root file, <em>tree1.root</em>,
          is the one created from the ROOT tutorial, <em>tree1.C</em></li>
        <li>A Python class, PyListOfLeaves, is created. Attributes with names
          of the tree leaves, and containing the leaves, are added dynamically
          to the class</li>
        <li>The Python module <em>AidaProxy</em> is imported. This module loads
          the dictionary for the PI classes, making them available in the Python
        environment in the global namespace.</li>
        <li>A 1D and a 2D Cloud are created</li>
        <li>The content of the tree is read, looping on its entries, and the
          histograms are filled</li>
        <li>The histograms are plotted using HippoDraw</li>
      </ol>
