      <h2>Creating and filling AIDA objects and plotting them in JAIDA</h2>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>1D and 2D Histograms, Clouds (Unbinned histogram), Profile 1D and 2D, DataPointSets and functions are created and plotted using JAIDA.</p> 
 

      <h3>Python program</h3>
      <p>Click to retrieve <a href="jaidaDemo.py">the Python script</a> of the example.</p>

      <p>After having <a href="howtosetup.html">setup</a> correctly your environment for PI, you need also to set theenvironment to use JAIDA, by typing (Bash shell): 
	 <br/>	<kbd>
	 . setup_JAida.sh <br />
	</kbd> 
<p>
afterwards, you can run the example typing :<br />
	<kbd>python -i jaidaDemo.py
	</kbd> </p>

      <h3>Program flow</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The Python module <em>AidaProxy</em> is imported. This module loads the dictionary for the PI classes, making them available in the Python environment in the global namespace.</li> 
        <li>1D and 2D HIstograms, Clouds and Profile are booked </li>
	<li>The histograms, clouds and profiles  are filled with various random data using functions available from the Python random package</li>
	<li>The JAIDA plotter is created using the pi_aida class Plotter which implements the AIDA IPlotter interface. This class loads a JAIDA plotter plug-in.</li>
	<li>Using the AIDA Plotter interface a zone containing 3x3 regions is created </li>
	<li>The 1D and 2D HIstograms, Clouds and Profile are plotted in various regions. For the clouds an automatic binning is used for plotting</li>
	<li>The 1D histogram is fitted with a gaussian function </li>
	<li>The resulting fitted function is plotted on top of the histogram</li>
	<li>A xy DataPointSet is created from the Profile1D data and plotted</li> 
	<li>A DataPoint Set created from a 1D vector of points with asymmetric errors is created and plotted</li>  
      </ol>
