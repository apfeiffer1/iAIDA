      <h2>Creating and filling AIDA histograms and plotting them in HippoDraw</h2>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Unbinned Histograms (AIDA Clouds), are created ("booked"), and filled with different random number distributions and then plotted using HippoDraw. 

      <h3>Python program</h3>
      <p>Click to retrieve <a href="hippoDemo.py">the Python script</a> of the example.</p>

      <p>After having <a href="howtosetup.html">setup</a> correctly your environment, you can run the example typing :<br />
	<kbd>python -i hippoDemo.py
	</kbd> </p>

      <h3>Program flow</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The Python module <em>AidaProxy</em> is imported. This module loads the dictionary for the PI classes, making them available in the Python environment in the global namespace.</li> 
        <li>1D and 2D Clouds are booked </li>
	<li>The clouds are filled with random data. The random data are generated with gaussian, exponential, log normal, gamma distributions using functions available from the Python random package</li>
	<li>The Python module <em>hippoPlotter</em> is imported, which imports the hippo module, python bindings to HippoDraw. The hippoPlotter module  defines a python class, <em>HippoPlotter</em>, which copies the AIDA histograms in HippoDraw objects (tuples) and shows them in the Hippo canvas </li>
	<li>An instance of the HippoPlotter class is created. This class creates a HippoDraw canvas and the HippoDraw Inspector</li>
	<li> The histograms are plotted in the Hippodraw canvas. The user can then fit
	  them, change the binning of the histograms, etc.... using the Inspector</li>
	<li> An AIDA 2 dim. DataPointSet is created from vector of x,y and error values. The DataPointSet is plotted as a X-Y Plot in the HippoDraw page. </li>
	<li> Binned 1D and 2D  histogram obtained filled from the clouds contents are plotted in Hippodraw</li>    
      </ol>
